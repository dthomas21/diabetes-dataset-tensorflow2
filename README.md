# diabetes-dataset-tensorflow2

This notebook uses the [diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html) using features such as age, gender, bmi, blood pressure, several blood serum measurements with a quantitative measure of the diesease's preogression one year after the listed baseline measurements.

The focus of this notebook is to show how effective regularization techniques (such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping) can be. This uses TensorFlow 2 to build models.
